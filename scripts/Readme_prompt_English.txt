Please ensure the README:

Focus on writing fluid, narrative explanations rather than excessive bullet points. Each section should contain complete paragraphs that explain concepts thoroughly while maintaining an engaging style. Use bullet points sparingly and only when they truly enhance readability.

The writing should:
* Use clear, professional language with complete sentences and paragraphs
* Include syntax-highlighted code blocks within explanatory text
* Incorporate helpful diagrams or screenshots that complement the written explanations
* Maintain consistent formatting while prioritizing narrative flow
* Provide detailed explanations accessible to both technical and non-technical readers
* Explain technical concepts thoroughly instead of relying on unexplained jargon
* Include troubleshooting guidance as part of comprehensive usage sections
* Weave references to additional resources naturally into the text

Feel free to suggest improvements or additional sections that would benefit this specific project based on the information provided.
